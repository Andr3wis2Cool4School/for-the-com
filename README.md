## how to see the code

**For each jupyter notebook file represent a step during our experiment**
>> each index represent one notebook file

1. Data Preprocessing and Data simple Expore
2. Clean Data using Regular expression
3. Traditional machine learning algorithms
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forests
4. Deep Learning method
    - Simple Neural network
5. Transformer architecture: Bert
    - Simple Bert Model
    - Bert + BiLSTM 

>> See the result plots in each jupyter notebook
>> 5, 6 is in the folder `5,6_Bert_and_Bert_BiLstm`
